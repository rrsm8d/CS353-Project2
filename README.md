# CS353-Project2
This is a class project for reading from a csv file, then searching and sorting off certain criteria

# How to run
1. Open MenuManager.rkt in DrRacket
2. Make sure you have the package csv-reading installed. You can install it from File → Install Package -> csv-reading
3. Navigate the menu from the console

# Potential Issues
1. It was unclear how searching by region should be done. My implementation returns only results that have more than 0 sales in a selected region.
2. Some entries in the csv file, such as Pokémon games, have errors in their special characters. Pokémon -> Pok�mon. This may impact search results.
